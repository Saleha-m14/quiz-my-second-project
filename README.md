 - People around the world that likes to see historical places.
 - Those who wants to know more about Bamiyan.

### Site Purpose

The purpose of this webpage is to share information about this historical province that is located in Afghanistan. It is intact and has a natural appearance.

### Site Goal

This site is designed for its visitors to get to know the beautiful and historical province of Bamiyan and the Buddha staues and the Band-e Amir dam that is located there.

### Requirements

This is a responsive webpage that I have created by using the technologies that I have learned. The development process needs to be well documented through a version control system such as GitHub. 
It is created using HTML and CSS.

### Design

This is the first webpage that I have worked on therfore, the design has been infuenced by the "Love Running" project.

My purpose was to design a website that includes informatin about this historical province named Bamiyan. And to let users know what can they do at this place. Why it attracts the attention of viewers.

The navigation menu is on the top of the webpage and the website is devided into many sections. The links to the social networks is addded to the bottom of the page.

#### Colors

The color palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co
)

### Testing

List of the main issues:

1. In the idex.html file the width and height attributes were added for the images of the Boddhas and Band-e Amir section and while validating the code with W3C Validator it caused an error.
- Solution: Removed the width and height attributes from index.html and added the width and height for images in style.css.
2. The color of heading was not visible.
- Solution: Changed colors by using Coolers that match the whole page.
3. There was an error that said the fourth section lacks heading.
- Added heading and div to that section.
4. The second and third sections texts and images were not responsive to smaller devices.
- Solution: On the style.css media query was added to be responsive to smaller devices. And the width and height was changed accordingly.
5. The cover text on the first section of the page was disapperaring on the right side on the width of samller than 446px.
- Solution: The bottom reduced to 105px, left to 94px.

Apart from these issues that I mentioned there have been several minor issues. The majority of these issues have been due to miss spelled tags, attributes, closing tag, and other mistakes.
